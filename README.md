# 100 Days of Machine Learning  

Welcome to my **AI & Data Science Learning Journey** repository!  
This repo documents my practice and learning progress through the **100 Days of Machine Learning** series by [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH).  

Iâ€™ll be following along with the videos, practicing concepts daily, and uploading code, notes, and exercises here.
