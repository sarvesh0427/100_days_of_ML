# 100 Days of Machine Learning ðŸ“˜  

This repository is my **AI & Data Science journey**, where I am following along with the **CampusX â€“ 100 Days of ML** YouTube series.  

---

## What I learned So Far  

### Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Machine Learning  
- Understanding what Machine Learning is.  
- How ML differs from traditional programming.  
- Importance of data-driven approaches.  

### Day 2 â€“ AI vs ML vs DL  
- Difference between **AI, ML, and Deep Learning**.  
- AI â†’ broader concept of creating intelligent agents.  
- ML â†’ subset of AI that learns from data.  
- DL â†’ subset of ML using neural networks.  

### Day 3 â€“ Types of Machine Learning  
- **Supervised Learning** â€“ learns from labeled data.  
- **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ finds patterns in unlabeled data.  
- **Reinforcement Learning** â€“ learns through trial and error with rewards.  

### Day 4 â€“ Batch Machine Learning  
- Training the model on the entire dataset at once.  
- Efficient for static data.  
- Not suitable for real-time or continuously changing data.  

### Day 5 â€“ Online Machine Learning  
- Learns incrementally from streaming data.  
- Suitable for dynamic, real-time applications.  

### Day 6 â€“ Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning  
- **Instance-Based**: Memorizes examples, compares new data with stored instances (e.g., KNN).  
- **Model-Based**: Builds a model based on training data and generalizes for predictions; understand behaviour, mathematical implementation to predict new point 

### Day 7 â€“ Challenges in ML
- Data Collection
- Insufficient Data / Labelled Data
- Non Representative Data
- Irrelevant Features -> Garbage In Garbage Out
- Data quality and quantity  
- Overfitting and underfitting 
- Bias and fairness
- Software Integration
- Interpretability and scalability.  

### Day 8 â€“ Applications of ML  
- Healthcare, finance, marketing, self-driving cars, recommendation systems, etc.  

### Day 9 â€“ ML Development Life Cycle  
1. Frame the problem
2. Gathering Data 
3. Data preprocessing  
4. EDA  
5. Feature engineering and selection
6. Model training, evaluation and selection
7. Deployment 
8. Testing 
9. Optimize

### Day 10 â€“ Data Engineer vs Data Analyst vs Data Scientist vs ML Engineer  
- **Data Engineer** â€“ builds pipelines, manages storage, handle database/ data warehouse.  
- **Data Analyst** â€“ cleaning/organizing data, analyzing(to derive insights), interprets and visualizes data; optimize data collection procedures. 
- **Data Scientist** â€“ A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. 
- **ML Engineer** â€“ deploys, scaling and optimizing ML models in production; monitoring and maintenance of deployed models. 

### Day 11 â€“ What are Tensors?  
- Multi-dimensional arrays used in ML/DL.  
- Foundation of frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.  

### Day 12 â€“ Installing Anaconda for Data Science  
- Setting up Anaconda for Python ML environment.
- Link: https://www.anaconda.com/ 
- Managing packages and environments. 
- Others platform: Google colab, Kaggle etc.

### Day 14 â€“ How to Frame a Machine Learning Problem  
- Defining the problem correctly is crucial.  
- Identifying input features, target variable, and performance metric.  
- Translating business problems into ML tasks.
